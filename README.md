## Quantum Field Theory – Self-Study Repository

This is a personal learning repository documenting my independent study of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). The project includes notes, solved problem sets, computational experiments, and reading logs. My aim is to deepen my understanding of the theoretical structure of quantum fields while building computational intuition.

## Topics Covered
- Canonical quantization
- Path integrals
- Scalar and spinor fields
- Interactions and perturbation theory
- Gauge theory basics
- Lattice toy models (ongoing)

## Organization

- `notes/` – Lecture-style notes and topic summaries (from Tong, Peskin & Schroeder, Srednicki, etc.)
- `problem_sets/` – Worked solutions to textbook and lecture problems
- `computational_qft/` – Code for simulating or visualizing QFT-related models
- `reading_log.md` – Timeline and commentary on my progress
