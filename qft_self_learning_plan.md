# QFT Self-Learning Roadmap

**Goal**: Build deep, structured understanding of QFT in parallel with research

## Stage 1: Core Concepts (Summer–Fall 2024)
**Focus**: Intuition + mechanics of canonical formalism

- Texts:
  - David Tong’s QFT notes
  - Peskin & Schroeder, Chapters 2–4

**Tasks**:
- Weekly LaTeX notes (host on GitHub)
- Derive EL and Hamilton equations from scratch
- Practice writing Lagrangians and Feynman rules

## Stage 2: Deepening (Winter–Spring 2025)
**Focus**: Loop corrections + formal tools

- Texts:
  - Continue P&S (Ch. 5–9)
  - Schwartz’s QFT and the Standard Model
  - Optional: Weinberg Vol. 1

**Tasks**:
- Write a small report (e.g., on renormalization or symmetry breaking)
- Attend seminars or journal clubs

## Stage 3: Specialization / Applications (Spring–Summer 2025)
**Focus**: Non-perturbative topics or cross-domain material

- Topics:
  - Instantons, path integrals (Coleman or Weinberg Vol. 2)
  - Light-front field theory (Ji’s group)
  - Applications in cosmology, condensed matter, or quantum information

## Final Output
- 1–2 LaTeX documents or mini-notebooks
- GitHub repo: `qft-notes` or `qft-from-scratch`
- Integration with computational projects (e.g., lattice QFT sim)
